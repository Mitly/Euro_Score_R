EuroSCORE: it stands for European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation. You can read about it in [here](http://www.euroscore.org/euroscore_references.htm) and use it [here](http://www.euroscore.org/calc.html).
Operative mortality is a good measure of quality of cardiac surgical care, as long as patient risk factors are taken into consideration. EuroSCORE is a method of calculating predicted operative mortality for patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
Nearly 20 thousand consecutive patients from 128 hospitals in eight European countries were studied. Information was collected on 97 risk factors in all the patients. The outcome (survival or death) was related to the preoperative risk factors. The most important, reliable and objective risk factors were then used to prepare a scoring system. The scoring system was prepared from part of the database and tested and validated on another part. This [scoring system](http://www.euroscore.org/euroscore_scoring.htm) is EuroSCORE.


An increasing number of European hospitals have tested EuroSCORE on their own patients and against other scoring systems. It is performing very well. Recently, the national British database was used to test EuroSCORE; it outperformed other simple scoring systems and approached Bayesian models in discrimination power. You can see a selection of [references](http://www.euroscore.org/euroscore_references.htm).
It is simple. If a risk factor is present in a patient, a weight or number is assigned. The weights are added to give an approximate percent predicted mortality. You can try the system for yourself with interactive [calculator](http://www.euroscore.org/calc.html) (available in six languages; English, Spanish, German, Italian, Finnish & French) or download a calculator for use [offline](http://www.euroscore.org/instructions%20for%20calculator.htm).


The simple additive EuroSCORE model is now well established and has been validated in many patient populations across the world. It is easy to use, even at the bedside. It is very valuable in quality control in cardiac surgery and gives quite a useful estimate of risk in individual patients. However, particularly in very high risk patients, the simple additive model may sometimes underestimate the risk when certain combinations of risk factors co-exist. The full [logistic](http://www.euroscore.org/logisticEuroSCORE.htm) version of EuroSCORE produces more accurate risk prediction for a particular high risk patient. Its main disadvantage is that the risk has to be calculated in quite a complex way - not by mental arithmetic or "on the back of an envelope".
EuroScore was updated and now it has only logistic version. [Here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22378855) you can find the full article by Nashef et al.
